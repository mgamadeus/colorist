# Colorist: A PHP Color Space Transformation Library

**Colorist** is a PHP library developed for sophisticated manipulation and conversion among various color spaces, drawing inspiration from the principles of Material Design for generating color palettes. It offers a versatile suite of functionalities for developers, designers, and artists to work with colors in a wide array of applications, from web design to digital art and beyond.

## Key Features

- **Diverse Color Spaces**: Supports numerous color spaces such as RGB, HSL, XYZ, LAB, and LCH, catering to a broad spectrum of color operations and transformations.
- **Seamless Interoperability**: Facilitates accurate and effortless conversion between color spaces, enabling complex color manipulations and analyses to fit specific requirements.
- **Material Design-Inspired Palettes**: Generate harmonious and visually appealing color palettes using LCH color space, leveraging the logic found in Material Design guidelines. This feature is particularly beneficial for UI/UX design, branding, and thematic applications.
- **Customizable and Extensible**: Built to be easily extendable for incorporating additional color spaces and conversion methods, ensuring the library remains adaptable to evolving project needs and color science advancements.

## Utilizing Colorist

### Color Classes Overview

Within **Colorist**, each color space is represented by a dedicated class, equipped with methods for conversion, manipulation, and analysis. Here's a brief overview:

- `RgbColor`: Represents colors in the RGB color space, offering methods to convert to other spaces and generate hexadecimal color codes.
- `HslColor`: Handles colors in the HSL color space, allowing for intuitive adjustments of hue, saturation, and lightness.
- `XyzColor` and `LabColor`: Facilitate working within the XYZ and LAB color spaces, crucial for color science and precise color matching.
- `LchColor`: Central to generating custom palettes, this class represents the LCH color space and provides methods for palette creation inspired by Material Design.

### Generating a Palette from an RGB Color

**Colorist** excels in generating cohesive color palettes from a base color. Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to transform an RGB color from a hexadecimal code into an LCH color and create a custom palette:

```php
use Colorist\ColorSpaces\RgbColor;
use Colorist\ColorSpaces\LchColor;

// Create an RGB color from a hexadecimal code
$rgbColor = RgbColor::fromHex('#3498db');

// Convert the RGB color to an LCH color
$lchColor = $rgbColor->toLchColor();

// Generate a palette based on the LCH color
$palette = $lchColor->createPalette();

// Display the generated palette colors
foreach ($palette as $color) {
    echo $color->toHex() . PHP_EOL;
}
```

This example demonstrates the library's ability to take a simple RGB color input and utilize it to produce a comprehensive and harmonious color palette, suitable for design projects that require a consistent and appealing color scheme.
